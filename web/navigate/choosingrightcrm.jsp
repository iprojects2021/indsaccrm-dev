	<h3>Things to consider when choosing the right CRM system</h3>
	<p class="para"> Before you start evaluating CRM vendors, ask yourself these questions:-</p><br>
<ul>
  <li>  1. What are the most inefficient processes in our business and what do we want to improve with a CRM system?</li><br>
 <li>   2. What operational processes and workflows do we lack and need to add?</li><br>
     <li> 3. Who in our company is going to use CRM? How many users do we need?</li><br>
  <li>    4. What other software do we want to integrate with a CRM system?</li><br>
    <li>  5. What is our budget? </li>
   </ul> <br>
  <h4>Know what features and functionality you need<h4>
<p class="para" > 
CRM software comes with a lot of functions that need to appeal to a wide spectrum of businesses. But, why pay for the 
functions you don't need or use. First-time CRM buyers often overestimate what features they actually need. Different users
need different user plans. Thus, sales departments might need a CRM with an advanced sales set and a possibility to use CRM
on their mobile devices; while your communication team may need to only use the marketing-related functionality. Choose a 
CRM that can adapt to your needs.
 </p><br>

<h4>Make sure the system integrates with other applications<h4>
<p class="para" > 
This is one of the most important things to consider when choosing a CRM for your business. CRM software integrates with: 
an ERP or other accounting software, HR software, your own website and web forms to import new leads, billing and e-commerce platforms to register transactions, as well as marketing solutions.
 </p><br>

<h4>Request a demonstration and test drive a free trial<h4>
<p class="para" >Never take a CRM system at face value. it's always a good idea to test it out. The best solution is to 
    start with a personalized demonstration and then move on to a free trial. During a demo session, a salesperson walks 
    you through the software and shows you how to use it. Then, you can ask specific questions that are related to your
    business. After that, you can move on to playing with a trial version to get a good feel of how everything works and 
    see the system's strengths and weaknesses. Look at things like ease of use, key functionality, and the ability to expand. </p><br>

<h4>Check whether customization and training are available<h4>
<p class="para" > A CRM system should complement your business and reflect your sales process, your marketing strategy, your
    customer service activities, your contact management routines. That's why you should choose a system that is easy to configure. So, when you're asking for a price, make sure to ask how much it will cost to configure the solution to your needs and to personalize training sessions. </p><br>
