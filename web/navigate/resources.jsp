	<h3>Why do businesses need a CRM?</h3>
	<p class="para">Customer relationship management is any tool, strategy, or process that helps businesses better organize and access customer data.
 It all started with handwritten notes but with the advent and proliferation of digital technology, it eventually evolved into databases stored on individual computers, and then the CRM definition shifted into something far more complex. </p><br>
<p class="para"> It was no longer just notes. Managing your business relationships with customers became a complicated 
    process. Now, to compete in any industry, you need a reliable system built on CRM software. Managing every aspect of the
    business can be made easier with a robust CRM system. It should readily understand the business, unite it with the 
    employees and customers alike and capture the business information such that one gets a holistic view of each customer in
    real-time.</p>

<h3> CRM system is really necessary for business</h3>
	<p class="para">CRM helps businesses build a relationship with their customers that, in turn, creates loyalty and customer retention. Since customer loyalty and revenue are both qualities that affect a company's revenue, CRM is a management strategy that results in increased profits for a business. At its core, a CRM tool creates a simple user interface for a collection of data that helps businesses recognize and communicate with customers in a scalable way.
Small businesses and even freelancers can benefit from CRM processes as well.</p><br>




	<h3>How to choose the best CRM</h3>
	<p class="para">Choosing the right CRM for your business isn't easy.<br>
The difficulty lies not only in the fact that there are many solutions and technologies to choose from. But you also have to consider deployment options, ability to customize, cost, scalability, and business value, before you decide.<br>
With so many things to consider when choosing a CRM for your business, there is another important thing that your own needs.</p>
